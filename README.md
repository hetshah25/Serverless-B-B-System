# Serverless-B-B-System
The cloud-based hotel reservation system is called The Serverless Bed & Breakfast. where clients can reserve hotel rooms, place food orders from the kitchen, and request a tailored trip package from the tour operator. Customers, tour operators, hotel management, and kitchens are the 4 entities that make up this system. A company that gives customers a personalised tour package is a tour operator. It oversees every arrangement made throughout the tour and informs visitors. Booking rooms or beds, collecting client feedback on hotel services, and charging for services are all responsibilities of hotel management. In addition to managing inventories and delivering invoices to hotel management, the kitchen is in charge of preparing food that has been ordered by clients. Customers can log in to the system or use the register to access services. This project uses both Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services in a multi-cloud deployment architecture. Serverless technologies are used to supply the backend, and a frontend is used to construct the system.
